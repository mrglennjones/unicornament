Pimoroni Cosmic Unicorn Christmas themed, PIR or Doplar Radar enabled.
Many thanks to my friend pb and pimoroni
 
This is further development of the Halloweenicorn script found here: https://github.com/mrglennjones/Halloweenicorn

It now uses a doplar radar RCWL-0516 sensor to detect human movement which works through windows unlike the previous PIR sensor
