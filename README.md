# unicornament ❄️🎅⛄🎄
Pimoroni Cosmic Unicorn Christmas themed, PIR or Doppler Radar enabled.
Many thanks to my friend pb and pimoroni
 
This is further development of the Halloweenicorn script found here: https://github.com/mrglennjones/Halloweenicorn

It now uses a Doppler Radar RCWL-0516 sensor to detect human movement which works through windows unlike the previous PIR sensor
